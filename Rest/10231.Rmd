### 1. Assignment

Are people happy about the restaurant? Find this out!
Goal of this competition is to learn predicting whether restaurant review is positive or negative.  

#### 1.1 Data format
All reviews store in a .csl files(train.csv, test.csv). Each line of train.csv contains a grade (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) and a review, separated by tab, for example:

**Score** | **Review**
----- | -------------
4     | I liked it!
2     | Awful place!

Each line of test.csv contains only review.  
**The goal is to predict whether review is positive (grade is 4, 5) or not (grade is 1, 2, 3).**

### 2. Synopsis




```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo() # Display information about system
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
