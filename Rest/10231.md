Are people happy about the restaurant? Find this out!
Goal of this competition is to learn predicting whether restaurant review is positive or negative.  

#### 1.1 Data format
All reviews store in a .csl files(train.csv, test.csv). Each line of train.csv contains a grade (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) and a review, separated by tab, for example:

**Score** | **Review**
----- | -------------
4     | I liked it!
2     | Awful place!

Each line of test.csv contains only review.  
**The goal is to predict whether review is positive (grade is 4, 5) or not (grade is 1, 2, 3).**
